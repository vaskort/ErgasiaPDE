# Ergasia PDE

A trip down to, my, memory lane. November 2009.

This website is the first one I made as part of the web development module at Techological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, now knowned as International Hellenic University.

A simple website that I built with tables (!) and vanilla JS. It used to give some info on some of the modules of the course.
